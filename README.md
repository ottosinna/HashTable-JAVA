The code provided implements a HashMap data structure, which is a type of hash table. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides constant-time average-case performance for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. The idea behind a hash table is to use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of values associated with those keys.

In this implementation, the HashTable class defines an array of HashItem objects, where each HashItem represents a key-value pair. The put method inserts a new key-value pair into the hash table by computing the index using the hash function and storing the HashItem at that index. The get method retrieves the value associated with a given key by computing the index and accessing the corresponding HashItem. The remove method removes a key-value pair from the hash table, and the contains method checks if a given key exists in the hash table. The code also includes methods for checking if the hash table is empty and getting the size of the hash table.
